        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Watch out Little Debbieâ€”this copycat recipe for Cosmic Brownies is a dead ringer for (if not better than) the original treat. Our recipe tester went as far as to call them "the most perfect brownie ever" thanks to the combination of a chewy and fudgy brownie, topped with a melt-in-your-mouth ganache, and crunchy sprinkles. This dessert will transport you back to childhood.</p>
