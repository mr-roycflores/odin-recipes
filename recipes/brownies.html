        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Watch out Little Debbieâ€”this copycat recipe for Cosmic Brownies is a dead ringer for (if not better than) the original treat. Our recipe tester went as far as to call them "the most perfect brownie ever" thanks to the combination of a chewy and fudgy brownie, topped with a melt-in-your-mouth ganache, and crunchy sprinkles. This dessert will transport you back to childhood.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Brownie</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>baking spray</li>
            <li>14 ounces (60% cacao) bittersweet chocolate bar, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons canola oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 1/3 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ganache</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>7 ounces (56% cacao) semisweet chocolate bar, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup rainbow candy-coated chocolate pieces</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Brownies: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 13- x 9-inch baking pan with aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on short sides. Coat foil and sides of pan with baking spray; set aside.</li>
            <li>Microwave chocolate and butter in a large microwavable bowl on HIGH, stirring in 30 second intervals, until fully melted and smooth, about 2 minutes total. Whisk in cocoa, canola oil, and vanilla until fully combined.</li>
            <li>Whisk sugar and brown sugar into chocolate mixture until combined. Add eggs, 1 at a time, whisking until smooth and combined after each addition, about 2 minutes total. Gently fold in flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking powder until just combined, making sure not to overmix the batter, about 45 seconds.</li>
            <li>Transfer to the prepared baking pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until set and a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs, 55 to 60 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest in pan on a wire rack until room temperature, about 1 hour. Once at room temperature, cover, and place in refrigerator; chill completely, at least 1 more hour.</li>
            <li>When brownie has chilled, prepare the Ganache: Place chocolate in a medium mixing bowl; set aside. Bring heavy cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high, stirring occasionally. Pour heavy cream over chopped chocolate; whisk until chocolate is fully melted, about 45 seconds. Whisk in butter and salt until smooth and shiny; set aside.</li>
            <li>Invert cooled Brownie onto a large cutting board and discard aluminum foil. Using a serrated knife, trim and discard outer edges, about 1/4-inch on all sides. Using an offset spatula, spread Ganache in an even layer over top of brownie. Sprinkle evenly with rainbow candy-coated chocolates. Chill Brownie, uncovered, until Ganache is mostly set, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut Brownie into 12 even (4- x 2-inch) pieces. Using the back of the knife, make an indent going crosswise along center of each brownie.</li>
